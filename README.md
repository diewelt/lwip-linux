# To test lwip on linux

# lwip-linux
This is a version of lwip running on Ubuntu

## 1. Ubuntu Setup
   Install libpcap-dev

   sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
	
## 2. Compile
   Go to the folder ./Debug, then run:
   
   make clean; make 
	
## 3. Run tests
   Must be run under root user 
   
### 3.1 Echo server test 
   Under the header file `./lwip-2.0.2/test/linux/lwip.h`, set `TEST_ID` to `ECHO_SERVER`
		
        #define TEST_ID 	ECHO_SERVER
		
   Then, re-compile the source code, and run the lwip-linux app. Use puty to connect to server at port 6677. 


### 3.2 TCP client test 
   Under the header file `./lwip-2.0.2/test/linux/lwip.h`, set `TEST_ID` to `TCP_CLIENT`
	
        #define TEST_ID 	TCP_CLIENT
	
   Then, re-compile the source code, and run the lwip-linux app. 
		
   Notes:
   - The remote server address is being hard code at "192.168.2.12", we can modify this address via macro TCP_REMOTE_SERVER_ADDR under ./lwip-2.0.2/test/linux/lwip.h.
   - Remote server port is 6677, it can be changed via macro TCP_REMOTE_SERVER_PORT. 
		

## 4. Other notes 
   - lwip-linux only supports 32 local server ports from 6677 to 6709. When we create a tcp server, please use the server port in this range.
   - For local client ports, the lwip-linux supports to allocate port in range from 49152 to 49184.
